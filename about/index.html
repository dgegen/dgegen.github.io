    <h1>Hi, I'm David</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a PhD student in the Queloz Group at ETH Zurich, specialising in the analysis of
      duotransits, with a general passion for formally reducing interesting physical questions to
      computationally tractable models. Moreover, I have a keen interest in scientific software
      development and am an advocate for fostering a scientific culture centered on self-consistent,
      open-source, reusable, reproducible and testable practices.
